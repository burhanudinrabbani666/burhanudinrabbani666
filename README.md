Hi, I’m Burhanudin Rabbani — currently embarking on my first year in the world of technology. I’m deeply passionate about open-source innovation, cutting-edge tech, and the intersection of art and creativity. I believe that technology, much like art, has the power to connect people and bring out the best of our shared humanity. My goal is to keep learning, growing, and contributing to the community — creating meaningful impact just as others have inspired me.
